Release notes for gbs 0.17
==========================

- Release Date: 2013-06

- New features added:
  * Totally local full build support
  * New gbs config refinements
    - 'work_dir' support in [general] section
    - 'buildconf' support  in each [profile] section, use buildconf to specify
      local build conf
    - string interpolation: ${key} can be used to reference keys defined in
      [general] section
    - 'packaging_branch' support in [general] section, which can be used to
      specify working or development branch, and the default is 'master'
  * --packaging-branch option added for gbs clone to specify working or devel
    branch
  * Support fetching build conf from standard RPM repodata
  * Create debuginfo and debugsource packages by default
  * Optimization:
    - report package dependency cycles in time
    - load dependency data during refresh repo, instead of during parsing every
      spec file
  * Bug fix:
    - get target arch from build conf if 'Target' is set in build config, which
      make gbs and remote obs generate the same arch for final RPM package
    - exit unexpectedly if cycles exist

Release notes for gbs 0.16
==========================

- Release Date: 2013-05

- New features added:
    * new subcommands 'createimage/cr' added, which can be used for developers
      to create image using ks file
    * performance optimization
      - put all build roots in a individual directory, which can be mounted as tmpfs
        to speed up building, based on our experimental build time can save 50%. We
        use 800 Tizen packages as test data, without tmpfs, gbs spent about 5 hours
        to build all packages, but with tmpfs enabled, only 2h, 25mins spent
      - avoid export multiple times for packages contain multiple spec files
      - refine createrepo: add --update for if repodata already exists
      - export: use lower compression level for orig tarballs
    * Add statistical of each errors, including export/expansion/rpmbuild errors
    * bug fix:
      - prereqs involved for dependency resolving
      - fix wrong @deps which contain version info
      - quote metacharacters in pattern to fix strip issue if metacharacters exist
